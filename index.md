# Overview

Project CASSIA (Comprehensive Architecture of Social Simulation for Inclusive Analysis) aims to develop a framework to administer to execute large-scale multiagent simulations exhaustively to analyze socially interactive systems. The framework will realize engineering environment to design and synthesize social systems like traffics, economy and politics.
The framework consists of:
* MASS Planning Module: a manager module conducts effective execution plans of simulations among massive possible conditions according to available computer resources.
* MASS Parallel Middleware: an execution middleware provides functionality to realize distributed multi-agent simulation on many-core computers.
